# MasterThesisJohann
This is a private repository where I stored the code for the data analysis of my master's thesis.

The Analysis includes Python code using the Libraries ScanPy and AnnData for the analysis of
single nuclei RNA sequencing data. This data was generated by the company Xpress Genomics at the
Center for Cancer Research of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

Furthermore there is some basic python scripts for processing fluorescence microscopy data that
I acquired at the Biomedicum of the Karolinska Insitutet, as well as for plotting data.
